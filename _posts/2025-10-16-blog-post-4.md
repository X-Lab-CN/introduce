We are thrilled to announce that our team’s paper, **“MSA: Multi-view Character Representation for Open-set Chinese Text Recognition”**, has been officially accepted to **ICCV 2025** — one of the top-tier conferences in computer vision!

📌 Key Highlights:

> Most existing methods treat open-set Chinese text recognition (CTR) as a single-task problem, primarily relying on prototype learning of glyphs or linguistic components to identify unseen characters. In contrast, humans recognize characters by integrating multiple cues — both linguistic and visual. Inspired by this, we propose a novel multi-task framework — **MSA (Multi-view Structure-aware Architecture)**.

✅ Innovations:
🔹 **SACE (Structure-Aware Component Encoding)**: Leverages a dynamic binary tree structure to emphasize core linguistic components, generating structure-aware and discriminative linguistic representations.
🔹 **SAGE (Style-Adaptive Glyph Embedding)**: Employs glyph-centric contrastive learning to aggregate features across diverse font styles, enhancing model robustness to stylistic variations.

📊 Experimental Results:
On the BCTR dataset, MSA achieves **1.3% and 6.0% accuracy improvements** under closed-set and open-set settings, respectively — significantly outperforming current SOTA methods!

💻 Code will be released soon — stay tuned!

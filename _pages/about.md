## 👨‍🎓Introduction

<div style="text-align: justify;">📚Xiong Yujie, an associate professor at <a href='https://www.sues.edu.cn/'>[Shanghai University of Engineering Science]</a>, was selected for the 2019 Shanghai Young Science and Technology Talent Sailing Program. He obtained his bachelor's degree in Automation from <a href='https://www.csu.edu.cn/'>[Central South University]</a> in 2011 and his Ph.D. in Computer Application Technology from <a href='https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/'>[East China Normal University]</a> in 2018. In October of the same year, he joined the <a href='https://seee.sues.edu.cn/'>[School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering]</a> at Shanghai University of Engineering Science as a lecturer and was promoted to associate professor in December 2021. His representative research work includes multi-language offline signature verification in complex scenarios, continuous large-scale action detection for video streams, multi-modal data fusion analysis for traditional Chinese medicine diagnostics, chain-of-thought reasoning technology for large language models, and high-fidelity 3D modeling for real-time dynamic small scenes. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">📖He has presided over more than 10 scientific research projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Project, Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission projects, Shanghai Municipal Education Commission projects, and enterprise-entrusted projects. He has also participated in major projects such as the Innovation 2030—"New Generation Artificial Intelligence" project, National Natural Science Foundation projects, and Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission projects. He has published over 50 academic papers and serves as a member of the program committees for several international conferences. As an expert with the ISO International Organization for Standardization, he has participated in the review of multiple TC249 traditional Chinese medicine standard projects and contributed to the drafting of national standards "Traditional Chinese Medicine—Diagnostic Vocabulary—Part 1: Tongue Manifestations" and "Traditional Chinese Medicine—Diagnostic Vocabulary—Part 2: Pulse Manifestations."</div>
